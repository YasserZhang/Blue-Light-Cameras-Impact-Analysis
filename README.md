# blue-light-cameras-impact-analysis

### Project Introduction
A Blue Light camera is a surveillance camera with a lamp radiating blue light installed on
its top. The camera is usually put in an open area such as road intersection. In addition to
monitor crime activities within its viewshed, it is also expected to have an effect in reducing
crimes with the help of its symbolic blue light, which is recognizable even from a distance of
hundreds of meters.
By the end of 2008, Rochester Police Department purchased 50 cameras and strategically
installed them in areas with high crime density based on the past crime records by the end of
2008. Ever since then, more Blue Light cameras were brought in and installed around the city
at various points of time. After the latest batch of cameras were installed in July 2016, the total
number has increased up to 136.
Since the installation of the first Blue Light camera in 2008, the RPD has not yet conducted
effectiveness analysis on those cameras. The objective of this project is to help the RPD to
quantitatively evaluate how effective these cameras are in reducing crimes in their vicinity.
Under the request of the RPD, this project put its main focus on felony activities instead
of all crimes. Therefore all hypothesis tests in the analyss process are implemented on the
dataset of felony activities.
